I have been following amFOSS for half a year now. I already looked at the tasks for the previous year so I knew I had to Install Ubuntu beforehand. It has been a month since I installed Ubuntu, it was a breeze. I have SSD + HDD storage option so I created a boot partition in my SSD and /home directory in my HDD. Recently, I got myself a Mac so I think I would be keeping Ubuntu as a backup in case my Mac starts to die on me. ðŸ˜œ
