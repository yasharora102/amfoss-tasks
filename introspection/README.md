# INTROSPECTION
## Why must we choose you?
Since I was 6 I've been fond of computers. Looking back to my teenage years, even though they were simple addition and subtraction programs I was quite fascinated by QBASIC. I'm very pasionate about coding and programming.Iâ€™m very eager to contribute for the welfare of society. I seek guidance in learning new languages and strengthening them. I am looking forward to participate in GSoC. Also I am intrigued by the recent boom in Deep Learning and would like to learn more about it. I believe amFOSS can guide me to my very best.
## What is your plan for the next 6 months?
I currently have 3 goals set in my mind.
* Learn new languages (Rust,GO,Python)
* Contribute for the betterment of society 
* Participate and get selected for GSoC 


With these three goals set in my mind I'll be working extensively to achieve them.
## How would you contribute back to the club?
I believe with Teamwork one can achieve and make others achieve their goals. I would be so happy to mentor my upcoming juniors and help my current batchmates with their problems.
## Do you have any feedback for the selection process?
No, the selection process has been fantastic. Providing updates to the mentors on a daily basis keeps me in check and prevents me from slacking off. The constant engagement with the mentors on discord makes me feel like there are people who care. The selection tasks are great and provide a good learning experience to the people who want to join.
